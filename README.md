# Skin-Track

- A wearable device that enables continuous touch tracking on the skin by movements of fingers was fabricated.
- A wearable ring that is used to generate the AC signals and a band as a carrier with electrodes was designed. 
- Processed the phase difference between the AC signals and thus, computed the 2D location of a touch by the fingertip.
- A linear regression model to predict the real-time 2D position and used it to control the PowerPoint presentations was trained.
- A PCB for the wearable device was designed .
