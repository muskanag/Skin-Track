# Skin-Track

- A wearable device that enables continuous touch tracking on the skin by movements of fingers.
- A wearable ring that is used to generate the AC signals and a band as a carrier with electrodes.
- Phase difference between the AC signals was processed and thus, computed the 2D location of a touch by the fingertip.
- A linear regression model to predict the real-time 2D position and used it to control the PowerPoint presentations was trained. 
- A PCB for the wearable device was made.
